# Notification
this directory contains the PDFs generated from the .tex files under semantic_web/tex/ 
plus an informal introduction to RDF(originally a .pages file on OS X).

# Explanation
* `dl_intro` is a simple introduction to description logic. Readers should have some prior mathematical logic knowledge. It's more like a window for beginners of the semantic web like me instead of a comprehensive sourece; please refer to the resources listed in it.

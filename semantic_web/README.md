# semantic-web
This repo is a collection of my personal notes for semantic web.
Although the term "semantic web" has appeared for more than 10 years, there are few educational resources for beginners(almost no online courses and lecture notes). W3C's specifications may be a way to start with, but the terminologies and definitions are scattered around, and it's hard to have a quick start. 

Based on my own experience, it's suggested to start with the textbook 'Foundations of semantic web technologies' by Pascal Hitzler, Sebastian  Rudolph, and Markus kr√∂tzsch. Readers are supposed to have some prior knowledge about mathematical logic, since this book views RDF more as a formal language. While reading this book, it's a good idea to refer to the W3C's specification for the same topic.

Personally speaking, I do not recommend the book 'A semantic web primer 3ed'. It's less formal and I find it more difficult to understand the concepts explained, which are introduced in a quite different way compared to the W3C's specifications and the book 'Foundations of semantic web technologies'.

Another possible way to start with RDF may be the resources provided by the cambridge semantics company, where you can find some brief introductions and videos.
